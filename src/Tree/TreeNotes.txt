Tree:

1.  root: top node in the tree, don't have a parent
2.  parent node : immediate(first) predecessor to that node
3.  child node : immediate successor to that node
4.  predecessor node: previous node to that node
5.  successor : next node to that node
6.  leaf node(External node): node don't have any child
7.  non leaf node(Internal node) : node have at least one child (1 or more)
8.  edge: link between 2 node
9.  path: sequence of consecutive edges from source node to destination node
10. ancestor of node : any predecessor node on the path from root to that node
11. descendant of node : any successor node on the path(s) from that node to the leaf node
12. common ancestor of 2 node: is the common ancestor for 1st and 2nd node
13. common descendant of 2 node: is the common descendant for 1st and 2nd node
14. sibling : children of same parent(Cousin)
15. degree of node : number of immediate children of that node
16. degree of tree: maximum degree among all node(max (degree of all node))
17. degree of leaf node = zero

18. depth of node : number of edges in the path from root to that node
19. height of node : number of edges in the (Longest) path from that node to leaf node
20. level of node : number of edges in the path from root to that node
					a)	Note: level of node = depth of node
					b)  Note: level of tree = height of tree
					c)  Note: level of node != height of node
					d)  Note: N node ==> N-1 edges
					e)  Note: depth of root = zero
