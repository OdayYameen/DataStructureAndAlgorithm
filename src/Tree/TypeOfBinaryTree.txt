BinaryTree:

1.  Maximum node at level i = 2 ^i
2.  each node have at most 2 children
3.  max number of node at height h = (2^(h+1))-1
4.  min number of node at height h = h+1
5.  min height if max number of node given = ceil((log2(n+1)-1)
6.  max height if min number of node given = n-1

Type of BinaryTree:
1.  Full/Proper/Strict	:
			a)  each node have either 0 or 2 children but not 1
			b)  no. of leaf node = (no. of internal node + 1)
2.  Complete BinaryTree: 
			a) all level are completely filled (Except possibly the last level)
			b) and the last level has nodes as left as possible,
			so if any child in last level not filled before right child then it is not completely BinaryTree
			
3.  Perfect BinaryTree:
			a)  all internal nodes have 2 children
			b)  all leaves are at same level
			c)  Note: each PerfectBT is Complete & Full BT
			    but not each Full or Complete is Perfect BT
4.  Degenerated(pathological) BinaryTree:
			a)  each internal node have only 1 child 
			b)  Note: LeftSkewed BT only have left children
			c)  Note: RightSkewed BT only have right children
			d)  Note: MixedSkewed BT have one child either right or left
